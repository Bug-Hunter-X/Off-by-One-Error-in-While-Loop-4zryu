This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java's while loop using post-increment operator. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from a misunderstanding of how the post-increment operator (`i++`) interacts with the loop condition.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering the order of operations when using increment/decrement operators in loops.
